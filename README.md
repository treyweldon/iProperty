## About The Project

Welcome to iProperty's project page!

This was an assigned team project with a deliverable timeline of 1 week. As a team we collaborated on the user flow, functionality, and navigating through the world of Git & GitHub collaboration workflows.

<summary><b>Technical Requirements</b></summary>

* Have at least 2 data entities (data resources) in addition to the User Model.
    * one entity that represents the main functional idea for out app and another with a One:Many or Many:Many relationship with that main entity (embedded or referenced).

* Use OAuth authentication.
    * Implement basic authorization that restricts access to features that need a logged in user in order to work.

* Have full-CRUD data operations somewhere within the app's features.

* Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - 
    * A consistent and polished user interface.
